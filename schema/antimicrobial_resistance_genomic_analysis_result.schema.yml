    gene_symbol:
      type: string
      doc: |
        The short name of a gene; a single word that does not contain white space characters.
        It is typically derived from the gene name.
      jsonldPredicate:
        _id: edam_data:1026
    gene_name:
      type: string
      doc: |
        The name of a gene, (typically) assigned by a person and/or according to a naming scheme.
        It may contain white space characters and is typically more intuitive and readable than a gene symbol.
        It (typically) may be used to identify similar genes in different species and to derive a gene symbol.

    coverage_depth:
      type: int?
      doc: |
        Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing
        a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence, described as fold coverage.
